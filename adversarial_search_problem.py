# An AdversarialSearchProblem is a representation of a game that is convenient
# for running adversarial search algorithms.
#
# A game can be put into this form by extending the AdversarialSearchProblem
# class. See tttproblem.py for an example of this.
#
# Every subclass of AdversarialSearchProblem has its game states represented
# as instances of a subclass of GameState. The only requirement that of a
# subclass of GameState is that it must implement that player_to_move(.) method,
# which returns the index (0-indexed) of the next player to move.
